# Non-block Load Tracer for SweRV-EH1
SweRV-EH1 implements non-blocking load path for load instructions without any dependency in next instructions. Processor jumps to next instruction while non-blocking load is being done. Results for non-blocking load are written back to gpr later.  

## Issue
Syncing non-block load result with it's respective PC and instruction could not be done due to irregular difference of cycle between them.  

## Solution
A separate log for nonblock log is generated by the tracer. Before Post-sim comparison, core log is updated using nonblock load log information via a postfix python script.

### Tracer Update for Non-block Load
GPR can by updated either from writeback from i0 writeback, i1 writeback or from non-block load result.  To trace this result, tracer signals were added at the writeback stage for enable, gpr address being written to and non-block load result. A separate nonblock load log is written to whenever nonblock load write enable is active. Log contains information regarding simulation time, cycle, gpr being written to and data being written back.

### Post-sim Core log Update
    
Purpose of the script `nb_postfix.py` is to find and replace the non-block load instruction in trace core log and update it with valid results.

### Post-sim Sequence Update

The postfix script is called in `sim.py` to update the trace core log before csv generation. CSV is generated from core log for post-sim comparison.
